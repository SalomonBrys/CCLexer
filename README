The Concurrent Compiler Lexer is a research project by Salomon BRYS at the University of Kent Canterbury.
This sub-project is part of the Concurent Compiler Toolkit, by Salomon BRYS.

It aims to provide developers a way to easily create very fast lexers by parallelizing and compiling their algorythms.

It uses :
  * LLVM to compile
  * Intel Thread Building Blocks to parallelize.
  * CoCoT/LLVMREGen to handle the regular expressions.
